"Various-sensors:

A -  DS18B20 temperature sensor:/Arduino Uno 

Make sure you add the OneWire library. Also, #define ONE_WIRE_BUS 3 is the digital pin you choose. 
In this example, I used digital pin #3. 
You can read the temperature on the serial monitor."

B - KY-008 650nm 5V Laser Module :/ Arduino Uno   
Digital pin 2

C- 3-color full-color LED SMD modules KY-009, flash each colour for a 2 sec, please ensure GND is connected.
    
D- The KY-027 Magic Light Cup module is a set of two boards. Each one has a LED and a mercury tilt switch.Using PWM to drive the LEDs on each module, you can achieve the effect of light being “magically” transferred from one module to the other when tilting them, similar to pouring water from one cup to the other, hence the name. (please search on google for wiring).
