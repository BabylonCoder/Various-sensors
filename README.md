"Various-sensors:

A -  DS18B20 temperature sensor:/Arduino Uno 

Make sure you add the OneWire library. Also, #define ONE_WIRE_BUS 3 is the digital pin you choose. 
In this example, I used digital pin #3. 
You can read the temperature on the serial monitor."

B - KY-008 650nm 5V Laser Module :/ Arduino Uno   
Digital pin 2
